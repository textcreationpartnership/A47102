            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Coke</hi> 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 331 in his Conſtruction of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 31. <hi>N.</hi> 2. ſaith that no perſons ſhall be impeached for any of the offences by preaching, teaching,<note place="margin">VIII.</note> or words, unleſs they be lawfully indicted within the ſpace of half a year, but yet it ſeemeth, that the words of the. Statute will not bear ſuch a Conſtruction, neither if they did, is it Law at this day, nor was then when the Inſtitutes were wrote.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For that 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 31. <hi>N.</hi> 2. refers only to the Caſe of Impriſonment, that where the Offender by preaching, teaching, or words is impriſoned, and is not indicted within half a year after the offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he ſhall be ſet at liberty and ſhall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52478:5"/>be no longer detained in Priſon for any ſuch cauſe or offence, and this was done in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of liberty, and to prevent a long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment upon a malicious and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs accuſation; but there is no colour to extend the words to the Offender, who was never impriſoned, altho the offence was by preaching, teaching, or words only.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Put the Caſe, that an Offender by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, teaching, or words had been impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned within the half year, yet it ſeems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry queſtionable, whether at the half years end, when he was ſet at liberty (as he ought to be by 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 31. <hi>N.</hi> 2. if he be not in the mean time indicted) he ſhould have been clearly diſcharged by this Act from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proſecution, during the half year then next following, for altho it be ſaid <hi>(he ſhall be no longer detained in Priſon for any ſuch cauſe or offence)</hi> yet that ſeems to refer only to his impriſonment before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and <hi>(detained)</hi> imports as much, <hi>Viz.</hi> That he ſhould not be continued or remain in the ſame impriſonment, which he ſuffered within the firſt half year, before any Indictment was found againſt him, but not that he ſhould not be indicted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards within the compaſs of the year, and if found guilty ſuffer the impriſonment and other penalties inflicted by this act; and it might ſo have happened, that an Offender by preaching, teaching, or words might have been accuſed, taken, and impriſoned a day or two before the half year next after
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52478:5"/>the offence expired, in which Caſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to be the meaning of the makers of the Law, that by his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a day or two he ſhould eſcape the penalties of the Law, and could not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards indicted within the compaſs of the year, and yet in that Caſe he ought to be ſet at liberty by the expreſs words of the Act, which ſaith <hi>(he ſhall be ſet at liberty if not indicted within half a year after the offence)</hi> and not half a year after his impriſonment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſeems now to be out of doubt, but that any Offender againſt 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. altho by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, teaching, or words, may be indicted at any time within a year and a day after the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed, and that by 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 8. <hi>N.</hi> 1. which ſaith, that all offences againſt 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. and 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. and 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. touching ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of her Majeſties Supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical ſhall and may be inquirable within a year and a day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the offence commmitted, and the affirming or maintaining the Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction of a Foreigner was without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion an offence againſt her Majeſties Supream Government in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, &amp; againſt the acknowledgment thereof, ſo that the year limited by 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 8. <hi>N.</hi> 1. is now extended to a day further: and what ever the meaning of it was as to the half year all offences againſt it, whether by preaching, teaching, or words, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe (for 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 8. <hi>N.</hi> 1. is general, and reaches all offences whatſoever againſt 1 <hi>Eli.</hi> 1.

                  <p>So that a Conviction upon an Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Recuſant upon 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 11. <hi>N.</hi> 1. or any other way, ſave by Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth not appropriate the penalty of twenty pound <hi>per</hi> month to the King for

                  <p n="2">2. In <hi>Hob.</hi> 205. Its ſaid that if a man at the making of 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 3. <hi>N.</hi> 1. had been Convicted of Recuſancy by any other means then by Indictment, he had not been bound by 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 3. <hi>N.</hi> 1. to pay the twenty ſhillings (it ſhould be twenty pound) a month from the Conviction, and if a man be now Convicted in <hi>B.

                  <p n="3">3. But if we compare together 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 2. which ſpeaks of a Conviction after the making of this Statute, and 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 1. which ſpeaks of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction before this Statute, the Contrary will evidently appear: for 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 2. <hi>N</hi> 1. muſt neceſſarily be intended of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions according to 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 5, <hi>N.</hi> 1. without any Proclamation, for the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Caſe of Recuſancy was not given until 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 5. <hi>N.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>And if a man had been Convicted of Recuſancy upon Indictment in <hi>B. R.</hi> or elſewhere before 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 5. <hi>N.</hi> 5. the forfeitures of twenty pound <hi>per</hi> month,

                  <p>Then comes 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 3. <hi>N.</hi> 1. which provides what ſhall be done upon Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the future, and appoints in that caſe, likewiſe the forfeiture of twenty pound <hi>per</hi> month to run on from the time of Conviction.</p>
                  <p>Both which Convictions as well before as after this Statute are granted to be meant only of Convictions upon Indictment, and there is no difference between the penning of theſe two Clauſes, 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 1.2. but that one reſpects the time paſt, and the other the time to come; but both appoint the penalty to run on. Now there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe that the makers of the Law intended the word (Convicted) in a more reſtrained ſenſe in this Clauſe 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 3. <hi>N.</hi> 1. then in the former Clauſe 29 <hi>Eliz</hi> 6. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 1. where the penalty ſhould have run on upon any Conviction whatſoever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Indictment, or that the Conviction in 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 1. by Indictment upon 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 5. <hi>N.</hi> 1. without Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be wholly ſhut out of the latter Clauſe, 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>By Conviction therefore in theſe Clauſes, 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 1.2. ſeems to be meant ſuch Convictions upon Indictment as were warranted by the Statutes in force at the ſeveral and reſpective times here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is to ſay, in 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 1.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52478:51"/>a Conviction upon 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 5. <hi>N.</hi> 1. without a Proclamation.</p>
                  <p>And in 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 2. a Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either with or without a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>In either of which Caſes the penalty of twenty pound <hi>per</hi> month ſhall run on by force of this Act 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 3. <hi>N.</hi> 1. and conſequently it ſhall run on, if the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant be Indicted, Convicted, and adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>B.

                  <p>And accordingly it was agreed 1 <hi>Rol.</hi> 93. in Dr. <hi>Foſters</hi> Caſe, that where the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant is Convicted upon Indictment, the penalty ſhould ever after run on, and be appropriated to the King and tis not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained there to a Conviction upon Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation only.</p>

                  <p>But this 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 6. <hi>N.</hi> 1. is not intended of entailed Lands: For without any aid of this Proviſo, if a Recuſant Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in Tail be convicted by Proclamation upon default and dieth, neither any Seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure for the Arrears of the 20 <hi>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr> per</hi> month ſhall enſue after his death; nor if they were ſeized in his life time ſhall the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure be continued after his death, nor is the heir in Tail bound to pay any ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears.</p>
                  <p>But if a Judgment be had againſt the Recuſant Tenant in Tail in his life time, the heir is bound in that Caſe.</p>

                  <p>In the late additions to <hi>Dalt. cap.</hi> 81. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Its ſaid that the matter of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancy ſtands in two particulars; Firſt, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from the Church; Secondly, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Oaths preſcribed 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 19. <hi>N.</hi> 4. and 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 15. <hi>N.</hi> 1. but this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Recuſancy is either too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or too large For if in the large ſenſe, then
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52478:67"/>the refuſing to receive the Sacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § <hi>N.</hi> by him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms and comes to Church, may be as fitly called a point of Recuſancy, as the refuſing the Oaths of Supremacy or Allegiance. But if in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe, then it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends only to the point of not coming to Church, and not to the refuſing the Oaths of Supremacy or Allegiance. And in this laſt ſenſe are all the Statutes to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which inflict any penalty or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility upon a Recuſant, or a Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, unleſs where the not receiving of the Sacrament is particularly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>And this appears by the explanation which the Statutes make every where of Conformity (the Oppoſite to Recuſancy) <hi>viz.</hi> repairing to Church, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 2. which ſaith, that the Popiſh Recuſant, which conforms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and repairs to the Church, ſhall receive the Sacrament, which words <hi>(and repairs to the Church)</hi> are explanatory of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (viz. <hi>which conforms himſelf</hi>) ſo that this Conformity is not intended of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Oaths of Supreamacy or Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but conſiſts only in repairing to Church, and conſequently Recuſancy (its oppoſite) properly ſo called, conſiſts in abſenting from Church.</p>
                  <p>And this appears further by 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>N.</hi> 3. where 'tis ſaid, that the Oath of Allegiance ſhall be required of him, who confeſſeth or denieth not himſelf to be a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52478:67"/>Recuſant, or that he hath not received the Sacrament, where (Recuſant) cannot be underſtood in any other ſenſe than of him who forbears to come to Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An Information or Indictment againſt a Popiſh Recuſant for Recuſancy, is of the form with that againſt any other Recuſant <hi>(viz.)</hi> that he came not to his Pariſh Church, or any other Chappel, Church, or uſual place of Common-Prayer, but forbore the ſame by the Space of, <hi>&amp;c. Co. Entr.</hi> 569. and 11 <hi>Co.</hi> 56. Dr. <hi>Foſters</hi> Caſe.</p>
                  <p>So that upon his Conviction of Recuſancy, it doth not appear upon Record, whether the Offender be a Popiſh or other Recuſant.</p>
                  <p>And therefore where this 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. § 3. <hi>N.</hi> 1. or any of the ſubſequent Statutes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or prohibits a Popiſh Recuſant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict to do a thing, and a perſon convicted of Recuſancy, who is a Popiſh Recuſant, be indicted thereupon, his conviction muſt be ſet forth in the Indictment, with this or the like concluſion, <hi>per quod praedict.</hi> A. B. <hi>devenit papalis recuſans convictus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So it is if a Popiſh Recuſant Convict be incapacitated to take, or to give, or diſpoſe of any thing, and another perſon be ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuted by the Statute in his ſtead, as in the Caſe of a Preſentation by 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. § <hi>N.</hi> in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> by the Chancellor and Scholars of the Univerſity, his Conviction muſt be ſet forth with an Averment, that he is <hi>papalis recuſans.</hi> 10 <hi>Co.</hi> 54.</p>
                  <p>And if a Popiſh Recuſant, whether convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not convicted, be ſo commanded, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52478:68"/>or incapacitated in an Indictment or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation upon the Statute, it muſt be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred that he is <hi>Papalis Recuſans.</hi>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52478:93"/>the recuſant ſhould have reſtitution of term again 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 278 <hi>Eyre</hi> verſ. <hi>Woodfine Paſch.</hi> 34. <hi>Eliz. &amp; Pellam</hi> Juſtice doubted thereof,<note place="margin">C.

But <hi>Anderſon Ch. I.</hi> and <hi>Walmſley</hi> held that the termor in this caſe ſhould have his term again in whoſoever hands the land came and upon whatſoever conſideration and not the money for which the term was ſold for the Outlary being reverſt it is as if there were no record of it, and the Queens intereſt was but conditional, <hi>ſcilicet,</hi> if the outlary were good, and judgment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this like the caſe where a Sheriff upon a <hi>fieri facias &amp; venditioni exponas,</hi> ſells a term, for there if the judgment be reverſed the party ſhall have the money for which the term was ſold, but not reſtitution of the term it ſelf as was reſolved 26 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 362.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon is becauſe the Sheriff did no more than he was commanded; for he was commanded to ſell, and therefore the ſale ſhall be good to all intents. But in the caſe of an outlary it is otherwiſe, and there is no ſuch command, which difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>fieri facias &amp; capias utlagatum,</hi> was agreed in Doctor <hi>Druryes Ca.</hi> 8. <hi>Co.</hi> 143.</p>
                  <p>A man is ſeized of an Advowſon in groſs,<note place="margin">Preſentment.</note> the Church becomes void, and then the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52478:93"/>is outlawed upon an indictment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſancy, whereupon the King preſents, the preſentee is inſtituted and inducted and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the outlawry reverſed; in this caſe the patron ſhall be reſtored to his preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>So if the patron of an advowſon in groſs hath judgment in a <hi>Quare impedit</hi> and is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards outlawed, for recuſancy and the King preſents, and the preſentee is inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inducted; in this caſe the patron ſhall have a <hi>fi. fa.</hi> to execute the judgment, and ſhall <hi>ouſt</hi> the preſentee of the King.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon in both Caſes is, becauſe upon reverſal of an Outlawry the party ſhall, be reſtored to all things which are principal and here the preſentment was the principal thing forfeited by the Outlary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon reverſal the patron ſhall be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it, <hi>Moor</hi> 269 <hi>pl.</hi> 421. <hi>&amp; Savil</hi> 89 <hi>pl.</hi> 166. <hi>Bluerleigh</hi> verſ. <hi>Cornwall.</hi>

For, if the power here given 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 41. <hi>N.</hi> 1. to the ſix privy Counſellours be the ſame with that of the Juſtices of peace in their Seſſions they may by force of this Act ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it to any Nobleman, or unmarried Noblewoman whatſoever above 18 years old, for the Juſtices of peace in their Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. §. 14. <hi>N.</hi> 2. may tender it there to any other perſon whatſoever: but, if it be meant of the power given the Juſtices of peace out of Seſſions, 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 13. <hi>N,</hi> 1. then the ſix privy Counſellours can tender it by force of this Act, 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 41. <hi>N.</hi> 1. to ſuch Noblemen or unmarryed Noblewomen only, who ſtand convicted or indicted of recuſancy for not coming to Church, or who have not received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament twice within the year next before, or who paſſing through the Countrey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſhall upon examination confeſs or deny their recuſancy, or that they have not ſo received the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>For the ſalving of which doubt it is to be conſidered, that the Biſhop and not the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Aſſize are here joyned with the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of peace, and theſe words 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 41. <hi>N.</hi> 1 (<hi>Where any Biſhop or Juſtices of Peace</hi> ſeem to bear this conſtruction, <hi>viz,</hi>

                  <p>But had the Juſtices of Aſſize been here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in all Caſes where the Biſhops Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Aſſize, or Juſtices of peace may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this oath, it had been clear that the power here 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 41. <hi>N.</hi> 1. given the ſix privy Counſellours was as extenſive as that which 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 14. <hi>N.</hi> 3. is given the Juſtices of Aſſize, or Juſtices of peace in their Seſſions, and they might have required the oath of any Nobleman or unmarried Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman whatſoever of competent age.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52478:106"/>It cannot be preſumed that the makers of the Law intended any difference between the perſons to be licenſed by the King or privy Counſellours, &amp; the perſons to be licenſed by the Juſtices of peace, the power given 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. § 7. <hi>N.</hi> 1. to the King or privy Counſellours being more abſolute, and not under ſuch praecautions, as is that which is given 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. § 7. <hi>N.</hi> 3. to the Juſtices of peace: for the King or privy Counſellours may grant a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to the Recuſant to travel without any particular Cauſe ſhewn in the licenſe, or the aſſent of any other perſon and, whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any oath to be made by the recuſant, which the Juſtices of peace cannot do, and there is no reaſon to think that the power here given to the King or privy Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which in all other Particulars is ſo much more abſolute and extenſive than that given to the Juſtices of peace ſhould be yet leſs extenſive as to the perſons to be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52478:107"/>ſhewn, or oath made, but he who is not convicted, is barred of that priviledge, and can apply himſelf only to the Juſtices of peace for a licence clogged with divers cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which are not required in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence granted by the King or the three privy Counſellours, 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. § 7. <hi>N.</hi> 1.</p>

                  <p>And the reaſon why in the two laſt Caſes the Wife ſhall not be barred of her Dower, altho there be an Eſtate limited to her for her life, is, becauſe the Eſtate is not in its firſt Creation appoynted to take immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the Husband, and no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ariſeth <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> can ſalve this, or make it a Joynture within 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8.10. § 6. <hi>N.</hi> 3. to barre her Dower.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And as in all the Caſes befo-rementioned
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52478:111"/>if the Eſtate were made for her Joynture, the Wife ſhall have ſuch Joynture and Dower, both (ſo if ſhe be an Offender within 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. § 10. <hi>N.</hi> 1 and conform not within the year next before her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's death,) ſhe ſhall forfeit the profits of two parts of both.</p>
                  <p>But otherwiſe it is where an Eſtate is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or limited by the Husband to the Wife, and it's neither expreſſed nor can be aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and proved to be given, or limited for her Joynture, or in recompenſe of her Dower, and therefore if any of the Eſtates before-mentioned, which are not within 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8.10. § 6. <hi>N.</hi> 1. be granted or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Wife by the Husband, or any other Eſtate for her life, or otherwiſe which would be a good Joynture within the ſaid Statute, if it were intended for a Joynture, as if a man before or after Marriage cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to ſtand ſeiſed of Lands to the uſe of himſelf for life, the remainder to his Wife for her life, and it is neither expreſſed in the deed, nor can be averred and proved that it was for her Joynture; Or if a man deviſe Lands by his laſt Will to his Wife ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and there is no mention in the Will that 'tis for her Joynture (for in this Caſe an Averment that it was ſo intended will not ſerve, unleſs there be expreſs words in the will to that purpoſe, Theſe Eſtates ſo gained by the Wife, as they do not barre her Dower out of the Reſidue of her Husband's Eſtate, but that ſhe ſhall

                  <p>And as the Wife ſhall have her Joynture and Dower both in ſuch Caſes where the Joynture is not purſuant to 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8.10. § 6. <hi>N.</hi> 1.

And the reaſon, why by ſuch Grants the Univerſity ſhall be barred, is, for that the Diſability here infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on the Recuſant is only a diſability to preſent, or to grant the next Avoydance, which extends not to any of the Grants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, nor ſevers the patronage from the Patron, as thoſe other Grants do.</p>
                  <p>And the intent of 3 <hi>Iac.</hi> 5. § 19. <hi>N.</hi> 1. is to prevent a Preſentation by the Recuſant or by him to whom he ſhould grant the Avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, who it was preſumed would preſent ſuch a one as the Recuſant ſhould appoint. But now when he grants the Advowſon it ſelf away, that Miſchief is prevented, and the Statute 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. § 19. <hi>N.</hi> 1. intended not in that Caſe to give away the preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Grantee to the Univerſity, <hi>Jones</hi> 19, 20. And yet if the Recuſants grant of the Advowſon in Fee or in Tayl, or for Life or Years, were by Covin or in Truſt on purpoſe to avoid this Statute, and be averred and found ſo to be, ſuch Grant ſhall not barr the Univerſity, 10 <hi>Co.</hi> 56. <hi>Jones</hi> 20. <hi>ſupra</hi> 246. <hi>N.</hi> 3.

                  <p>To this it hath been objected that when 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. § 18. <hi>N.</hi> 1. diſables the Recuſant to grant any Avoidance, it diſables him to grant it to the King as well as to any other perſon; but if the Recuſant may forfeit the Advowſon to the King, he may forfeit the avoidance to the King, and every forfeiture being a Grant or Gift in Law, as <hi>Com.</hi> 260.263.

                  </p>
                  <p>But yet I conceive that 7 <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. § 26. <hi>n.</hi> 4. By theſe words (<hi>Any one Iuſtice of peace within whoſe Commiſſion or Power,</hi> &amp;c.) is deſigned or intended no other Juſtice than a Juſtice of that County where the Party was complained of, and ſuſpected: and that if he fly into another County, no proceedings can be there upon the Complaint and Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion in the County whence he came, nor any one Juſtice tender him the Oath, or committ him for Refuſal, without a new Complaint and Cauſe of Suſpicion in the County whither he flyeth.</p>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52478:130"/>ſecond Tender for the Offence for which the Party muſt be indicted, is a complicated Offence conſiſting of ſeveral Particulars, 1. In giving juſt cauſe of Suſpicion without which the Party complain'd of according to this Act, 7 <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. § 26. <hi>n.</hi> 4: cannot be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Oath by one Juſtice of Peace. Then 2. In refuſing the Oath before the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace who tendered it. And laſtly, 3. In refuſing it upon the ſecond Tender at the Aſſizes or Seſſions, all which muſt be comprized in the Indictment.</p>
                  <p>So that the cauſe of Suſpicion is <hi>pars com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis,</hi> and that ariſing in the County where the Party dwelt, and was complained of, cannot be puniſhed in another County, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Statute 7 <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. § 26. <hi>n.</hi> 4. had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presſly made it examinable there, <hi>ſupra</hi> 184.</p>
                  <p>True it is that ſome Statutes do enable Juſtices of Peace to puniſh an Offence done in another County, but that is where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them likewiſe to examin the truth of the Fact, and take Proceſs and Evidence thereof. So 1 <hi>Iac.</hi> 27. § 5. <hi>n.</hi> 2. and 7 <hi>Iac.</hi> 11. § 8. <hi>n.</hi> 3. and <hi>ſupra</hi> 255. impower the Juſtices of Peace where the Party is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to examin and puniſh the Offence, but in our Caſe the cauſe of Suſpicion ariſing in one County is not made examinable, and conſequently not puniſhable in another County, and if not puniſhable there no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace of that other County can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon that cauſe of Suſpicion notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Party happen to be within his Commiſſion or Power.</p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:52478:130"/>
                  <p>But yet the Party ſo flying into another County may without any Complaint or cauſe of Suſpicion be tendered the Oath, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt there by two Juſtices of Peace <hi>Quorum unus, &amp;c.</hi> by vertue of the fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words of this Clauſe, 7 <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. § 26. <hi>n.</hi> 2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Note:</hi> That <hi>Dalton</hi> 107. <hi>Cap.</hi> 45. ſaith, it ſeems requiſite that the Juſtice or Juſtices of Peace do make like Certificat, as 3 <hi>Iac.</hi> 4. § 13. <hi>n.</hi> 5. at the next Aſſizes or Quarter-Seſſions of ſuch Perſons as have taken this Oath before them by force of 7 <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. § 26. <hi>n.</hi> 4.

                  <p>And as for the Seſſions, I conceive neither the Juſtices of Peace, if they proceed on 7 <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. § 26: <hi>n.</hi> 4. and not upon 3 <hi>Iac.</hi> 4. § 13. <hi>n.</hi> 5. are bound to make ſuch Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate,

                  <p>But yet in ſuch Caſes where the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are impowered by both theſe Statutes to require and miniſter this oath, as where the Party is convicted of Recuſancy, in which Caſe two Juſtices of the Peace, <hi>Quorum unus &amp;c.</hi> may require the Oath by the Special words in this Clauſe of 7 <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. § 26. <hi>n.</hi> 2. or of the General words in this Clauſe of 7 <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. § 26. <hi>n.</hi> 2. And it doth not appear upon which of theſe Statutes they proceed, as it may ſometimes ſo happen there, if the Party take it, will be fafeſt for the two Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to make ſuch Certificate to the next Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or Quarter-Seſſions, as is appointed, 3 <hi>Iac.</hi> 4. § 13. <hi>n.</hi> 5. and for the Clerk of the Peace or Town-Clerk to record it.</p>

                  <p>And the Reaſon is for that, when the Husband ſtands charged with the Penalty
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52478:133"/>of XX. <hi>lib.</hi> per Month for the abſence of the Wife, the Intent is ſatisfied in reſpect of thoſe Months of her abſence for which he ſtands ſo charged, for if he pay not the XX <hi>lib.</hi> per Month ſo recovered, the King or Informer hath the ordinary Remedy after Judgment by Proceſs or <hi>Capias</hi> againſt them both, and the Intent of the Act. 7 <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. § 28. <hi>N.</hi> 1. was no more than that the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhould pay for the Recuſancy of his Wife, or the Wife be impriſoned.</p>
                  <p>And if in this Caſe the Privy Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Biſhop, or Juſtices of Peace ſhould have power to inform the Wife, unleſs the Husband would pay ten <hi>lib.</hi> for the Months for which the King or Informer hath reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, it would follow that the Husband hath his Election whether he will pay ten Pounds <hi>per</hi> Month to the King by force of this Act, 7 <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. § 26. <hi>N.</hi> 1. or the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pound per Month ſo recovered againſt him by the King or Informer; for he ſhall not pay both the one and the other, for that were by his <hi>puniri pro uno delicto:</hi> and if he ſhall have his Election, the King or Informer might by this device be eluded of the Penalty of twenty <hi>lib.</hi> per Month ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, which could not be the intent of the Makers of this Law.</p>
                  <p>But if the Wiſe be after ſuch Conviction impriſoned by force of this Act, 7 <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. § 28. <hi>N.</hi> 1. neither the King or Informer can ſo ſue the Husband and Wife for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſancy of the Wife, for ſhe is already pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52478:133"/>by this Act, and muſt remain in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon until the Husband pay the ten <hi>lib.</hi> for every Month, or yield the Thirds of his Lands to the King, or the Wife, conforms.</p>
                  <p>So if the Husband yields the Thirds of his Lands to ſave his Wifes impriſonment, he is already puniſhed by this Act, 7 <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. § 28. <hi>N.</hi> 1. and ſhall not again be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed or ſued by the King or Informer, either upon 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 11. <hi>N.</hi> 1. or 35 <hi>Elez.</hi> 1. § 10. <hi>N.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>And if after ſuch Conviction of the Wife he pay ten <hi>lib.</hi> per Month, to ſave her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, he cannot be ſued with his Wife for the twenty <hi>lib.</hi> per Month upon either of thoſe Statutes by the King or Informer, for theſe Months of her abſence from Church incurred after her Conviction, for which he hath paid the twenty <hi>lib.</hi> month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the King; for he ſhall not <hi>bis puniri pro uno delicto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto hath been ſpoken of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the Wife at the King's Suit alone by Action of Debt. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Qui cam, &amp;c.</hi> which doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the Penalty to the King by 29 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 4. <hi>N.</hi> 1. or 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 8. <hi>N.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>If the Wife be Convicted of Recuſancy upon an Indictment, it hath been much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated whether that doth not appropriate the Penalty of twenty <hi>lib.</hi> per Month to the King for the time to come, by 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. § 4. <hi>N.</hi> 1. and 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 1. <hi>N.</hi> 2. that the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52478:134"/>King cannot bring an Action of Debt, or the Informer any Popular Suit againſt the Husband and Wife for any Offence of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancy committed by the Wife after ſuch Conviction. <hi>ſupra</hi> 79. <hi>N.</hi> 17. and 173. <hi>N.</hi> 2. However, admitting they may yet now, if the King take advantage of this Statute, 7 <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. § 28. <hi>N.</hi> 1. and the Wife be either impriſoned, or the Husband yields the third part of his Lands to the King, there is no queſtion but the King and the Informer are both barred to ſue for the twenty <hi>lib.</hi> per Month for any time incurred after her Conviction, for the King hath made his Election to puniſh her this way, and the Informer cannot ſue her, for ſhe is puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed already at the Suit of the King. And if the Husband pay the ten <hi>lib.</hi> per Month, the King and Informer are likewiſe barred for thoſe Months of her abſence from Church, incurred after her Conviction, for which the Husband hath paid the ten <hi>lib.</hi> monthly to the King, for he ſhall not be twice puniſhed for the ſame Offence.</p>
